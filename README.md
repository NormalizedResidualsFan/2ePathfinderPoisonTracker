# 2ePathfinderPoisonTracker
This script was made to facilitate tracking various poisons applied to multiple individuals mid-combat in Pathinder 2nd Edition

It is intended to be run from a terminal with python 3.0 (or newer)

It will print out to terminal a set of poison victims as entered by the user, with remaining round durations and present poison stage. Remaining round durations may be decremented individually or all active victims may have their rounds remaining decremented simultaneously

Only common and uncommon injury poisons, as found on 2e.aonprd.com as of 2023-01-22, are included here
